# Shift Register Exercise

Create a breakout for the SN74HC595 shift regsiter ([Texas instruments website and datasheet](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595))

## Purpose

Develop a custom library for bit banging a shift register

## Goals

- Create custom library for bitbanging shift registers
  - Forwards and backwards (most significant bit and least significant bit)
  - Clear board
- Vertical mount thruhole resistors
- Use 2.54mm/0.1 inch pinheaders for breadboarding & reuseability
  -([See SPI-i2c Excercise](https://github.com/peterbrundo/PCB/tree/master/SPI-I2C-PWM%20Excersize)
- Use stencil, solder paste, and hot air to solder 0805 leds

## Thoughts and reflections
- The stencil turned out very large, so on recomendation I got myself some aviation metal cutting snips
- I used a metal putty knife to spread the solder which ended up sticking to the knife afterwards (big mistake)
- Easter eggs are from office space
- Consider daisy chaining these together
- Consider Max current draw per output pin
