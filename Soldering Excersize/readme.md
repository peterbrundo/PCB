# Soldering Practice
## Purpose
- First ever PCB (outside of work)
- Use spare parts on hand
  - Use NPN transistor
  - Use optoisolator
  - Voltage divider
- Different voltages +3.3V , +5V
- Surface mount soldering
  - 0805 Led & Resistor circuits
- Soldering practice

## Thoughts and reflections
- Good soldering practice
- Hard to re-use the board for other projects
  - next time include mounting holes
  - better breakouts for pin headers (hook up connections)
- [x] Never look back
